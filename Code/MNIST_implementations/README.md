## MNIST Implementations

On this project, I've worked together with:

Vicente Valencia, PUC student and research partner. [Click here to go to Vicente's github](https://github.com/Vince-Valence).

The goal was to experience first hand how a beginner in deep learning would perform using 4 big frameworks: Tensorflow, Torch, MxNet and Keras. We did this by implementing the same neural network on these frameworks and describing our experience.

My main contribution was to implement the MxNet and Keras code and helping develop de mnist data loader. For the final report we shared our experiences and build a recommendation for beginners.
